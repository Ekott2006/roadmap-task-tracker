# Task Tracker

## Description
In this tutorial, we will build a simple CLI Task Tracker application that tracks and manages a to-do list. You will learn how to apply OOP concepts and create maintainable code. We will use **TypeScript** (for its static typing), but knowledge of TypeScript or JavaScript is not required.
